            <div class="accordion-item">
                <div class="accordion-header">
                    <h3>1. What is the difference between specific var, let, and const in JavaScript?</h3>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down accordion-icon"></i>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        <strong>var</strong> is function-scoped and can be redeclared and updated. It is hoisted to the
                        top of its scope.<br><br>
                        <strong>let</strong> is block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared within the same
                        scope.<br><br>
                        <strong>const</strong> is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared. It must be
                        initialized during declaration.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <div class="accordion-item">
                <div class="accordion-header">
                    <h3>2. Explain the concept of "Close" in JavaScript.</h3>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down accordion-icon"></i>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its
                        surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an
                        outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a
                        function is created, at function creation time.

            <div class="accordion-item">
                <div class="accordion-header">
                    <h3>3. What is the Virtual DOM in React?</h3>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down accordion-icon"></i>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        The Virtual DOM is a programming concept where a virtual representation of a UI is kept in
                        memory and synced with the "real" DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called
                        reconciliation. It enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the
                        UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute
                        manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to
                        build your app.

                    <h3>4. Explain Event Bubbling and Capturing.</h3>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down accordion-icon"></i>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Event Bubbling</strong> is the process where an event propagates from the target element
                        up to the root of the document.<br><br>
                        <strong>Event Capturing</strong> is the opposite process, where the event goes from the root
                        down to the target element.<br><br>
                        In the standard DOM Event flow, capturing happens first (down to target), then the target phase,
                        and then bubbling (up from target).

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        The "this" keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on
                        where it is used:<br>
                        - In a method, this refers to the owner object.<br>
                        - Alone, this refers to the global object.<br>
                        - In a function, this refers to the global object.<br>
                        - In strict mode, in a function, this is undefined.<br>
                        - In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous
                        operation. Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of
                        passing callbacks into a function.
